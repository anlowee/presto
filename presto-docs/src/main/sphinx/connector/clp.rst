Overview
--------

The CLP Connector enables SQL-based querying of `CLP <https://github.com/y-scope/clp>`_ archives via Presto. This
document describes how to configure the CLP Connector for use with a CLP cluster, as well as essential details for
understanding the CLP connector.


Configuration
-------------

To configure the CLP connector, create a catalog properties file ``etc/catalog/clp.properties`` with at least the
following contents, modifying the properties as appropriate:

.. code-block:: ini

    connector.name=clp
    clp.metadata-provider-type=mysql
    clp.metadata-db-url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306
    clp.metadata-db-name=clp_db
    clp.metadata-db-user=clp_user
    clp.metadata-db-password=clp_password
    clp.metadata-filter-config=/path/to/metadata-filter-config.json
    clp.metadata-table-prefix=clp_
    clp.split-provider-type=mysql


Configuration Properties
------------------------

The following configuration properties are available:

================================== ======================================================================== =========
Property Name                      Description                                                              Default
================================== ======================================================================== =========
``clp.polymorphic-type-enabled``   Enables or disables support for polymorphic types in CLP, allowing the   ``false``
                                   same field to have different types. This is useful for schema-less,
                                   semi-structured data where the same field may appear with different
                                   types.

                                   When enabled, type annotations are added to conflicting field names to
                                   distinguish between types. For example, if an ``id`` column appears with
                                   both an ``int`` and ``string`` types, the connector will create two
                                   columns named ``id_bigint`` and ``id_varchar``.

                                   Supported type annotations include ``bigint``, ``varchar``, ``double``,
                                   ``boolean``, and ``array(varchar)`` (See `Data Types`_ for details). For
                                   columns with only one type, the original column name is used.
``clp.metadata-provider-type``     Specifies the metadata provider type. Currently, the only supported      ``mysql``
                                   type is a MySQL database, which is also used by the CLP package to store
                                   metadata. Additional providers can be supported by implementing the
                                   ``ClpMetadataProvider`` interface.
``clp.metadata-db-url``            The JDBC URL used to connect to the metadata database. This property is
                                   required if ``clp.metadata-provider-type`` is set to ``mysql``.
``clp.metadata-db-name``           The name of the metadata database. This option is required if
                                   ``clp.metadata-provider-type`` is set to ``mysql`` and the database name
                                   is not specified in the URL.
``clp.metadata-db-user``           The database user with access to the metadata database. This option is
                                   required if ``clp.metadata-provider-type`` is set to ``mysql`` and the
                                   database name is not specified in the URL.
``clp.metadata-db-password``       The password for the metadata database user. This option is required if
                                   ``clp.metadata-provider-type`` is set to ``mysql``.
``clp.metadata-filter-config``     The absolute path of the metadata filter config file.
``clp.metadata-table-prefix``      A string prefix prepended to all metadata table names when querying the
                                   database. Useful for namespacing or avoiding collisions. This option is
                                   required if ``clp.metadata-provider-type`` is set to ``mysql``.
``clp.metadata-expire-interval``   Defines how long, in seconds, metadata entries remain valid before they  600
                                   need to be refreshed.
``clp.metadata-refresh-interval``  Specifies how frequently metadata is refreshed from the source, in       60
                                   seconds. Set this to a lower value for frequently changing datasets or
                                   to a higher value to reduce load.
``clp.split-provider-type``        Specifies the split provider type. By default, it uses the same type as  ``mysql``
                                   the metadata provider with the same connection parameters. Additional
                                   types can be supported by implementing the ``ClpSplitProvider``
                                   interface.
================================== ======================================================================== =========


Metadata and Split Providers
----------------------------

The CLP connector relies on metadata and split providers to retrieve information from various sources. By default, it
uses a MySQL database for both metadata and split storage. We recommend using the CLP package for log ingestion, which
automatically populates the database with the required information.

If you prefer to use a different source--or the same source with a custom implementation--you can provide your own
implementations of the ``ClpMetadataProvider`` and ``ClpSplitProvider`` interfaces, and configure the connector
accordingly.

Metadata Filter Config File
----------------------------

The configuration file defines metadata filters for different scopes:

- **Catalog-level**: applies to all schemas and tables under the catalog.
- **Schema-level**: applies to all tables under the specified catalog and schema.
- **Table-level**: applies to the fully qualified ``catalog.schema.table``.

.. note::
   All filters defined for a table in the configuration file must be present in the query and eligible for push down. If any required filter is missing or cannot be pushed down, the query will be rejected.

   Supported translations for Metadata SQL for now:

   - Comparisons between variables and constants (e.g., ``=``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``).
   - Dereferencing fields from row-typed variables.
   - Logical operators ``AND``, ``OR``, and ``NOT``.

Each scope maps to a list of filter definitions. Each filter includes:

- ``filterName``: must match a column name in the tableâ€™s schema.

  .. note::
     Only numeric-type columns can currently be used as metadata filters.

- ``rangeMapping`` *(optional)*: specifies how the filter should be remapped when it targets metadata-only columns.

  .. note::
     This option is only valid if the column is numeric type.

  For example, a condition like:

  ::

     "msg.timestamp" > 1234 AND "msg.timestamp" < 5678

  will be rewritten as:

  ::

     end_timestamp > 1234 AND begin_timestamp < 5678

  This ensures that metadata-based filtering produces a superset of the actual result.

Here is an example of a metadata filter config file:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "clp": {
        "filters": [
          {
            "filterName": "level"
          }
        ]
      },
      "clp.default": {
        "filters": [
          {
            "filterName": "author"
          }
        ]
      },
      "clp.default.table_1": {
        "filters": [
          {
            "filterName": "msg.timestamp",
            "rangeMapping": {
              "lowerBound": "begin_timestamp",
              "upperBound": "end_timestamp"
            }
          },
          {
            "filterName": "file_name"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Explanation:

- The top-level keys in this JSON object (``"clp"``, ``"clp.default"``, and ``"clp.default.table_1"``) represent **scopes** where metadata filters apply:

  - ``"clp"``: filters applied globally to all schemas and tables under the ``clp`` catalog.
  - ``"clp.default"``: filters applied to all tables under the ``clp.default`` schema.
  - ``"clp.default.table_1"``: filters applied specifically to the table named ``table_1`` under ``clp.default``.

- Each scope contains a list of ``filters``, where each filter specifies a field name via ``filterName``. The field name must match a column in the logical schema.

- Some filters (like ``"msg.timestamp"``) include an optional ``rangeMapping`` block. This is used to map the filter to physical metadata columns:

  - In this example, filtering by ``"msg.timestamp"`` will be rewritten as a condition involving ``begin_timestamp`` and ``end_timestamp``, allowing the engine to prune files or splits that don't match the filter.

- Filters without a ``rangeMapping`` (like ``"level"``, ``"author"``, or ``"file_name"``) are used as-is and must directly correspond to metadata columns in the split metadata schema.

This configuration enables flexible, hierarchical specification of which metadata filters are valid for which tables, and how they should be mapped to physical metadata fields for push down and split filtering.

Data Types
----------

The data type mappings are as follows:

====================== ====================
CLP Type               Presto Type
====================== ====================
``Integer``            ``BIGINT``
``Float``              ``DOUBLE``
``ClpString``          ``VARCHAR``
``VarString``          ``VARCHAR``
``DateString``         ``VARCHAR``
``Boolean``            ``BOOLEAN``
``UnstructuredArray``  ``ARRAY(VARCHAR)``
``Object``             ``ROW``
(others)               (unsupported)
====================== ====================

String Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

CLP uses three distinct string types: ``ClpString`` (strings with whitespace), ``VarString`` (strings without
whitespace), and ``DateString`` (strings representing dates). Currently, all three are mapped to Presto's ``VARCHAR``
type.

Array Types
^^^^^^^^^^^

CLP supports two array types: ``UnstructuredArray`` and ``StructuredArray``. Unstructured arrays are stored as strings
in CLP and elements can be any type. However, in Presto arrays are homogeneous, so the elements are converted to strings
when read. ``StructuredArray`` type is not supported in Presto.

Object Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^

CLP stores metadata using a global schema tree structure that captures all possible fields from various log structures.
Internal nodes may represent objects containing nested fields as their children. In Presto, we map these internal object
nodes to the ``ROW`` data type, including all subfields as fields within the ``ROW``.

For instance, consider a table containing two distinct JSON log types:

Log Type 1:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "msg": {
       "ts": 0,
       "status": "ok"
     }
   }

Log Type 2:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "msg": {
       "ts": 1,
       "status": "error",
       "thread_num": 4,
       "backtrace": ""
     }
   }

In CLP's schema tree, these two structures are combined into a unified internal node (``msg``) with four child nodes:
``ts``, ``status``, ``thread_num`` and ``backtrace``. In Presto, we represent this combined structure using the
following ``ROW`` type:

.. code-block:: sql

   ROW(ts BIGINT, status VARCHAR, thread_num BIGINT, backtrace VARCHAR)

Each JSON log maps to this unified ``ROW`` type, with absent fields represented as ``NULL``. The child nodes (``ts``,
``status``, ``thread_num``, ``backtrace``) become fields within the ``ROW``, clearly reflecting the nested and varying
structures of the original JSON logs.

SQL support
-----------

The connector only provides read access to data. It does not support DDL operations, such as creating or dropping
tables. Currently, we only support one ``default`` schema.
